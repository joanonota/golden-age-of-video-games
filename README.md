# golden-age-of-video-games
This is a project to showcase my SQL skills in Data Manipulation. The aim of this project was to analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. 
I used joins between the datasets and set theory to compare the results. It also involved filtering, grouping and ordering of the data.
